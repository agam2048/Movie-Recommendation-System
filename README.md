Recommendation system is all about recommending the next content to its user.
The idea of this project is to use the given dataset and to recommend suggestions of similar movies
The suggestions of the movies will be based on the description of the movie or the genre of the names of movies provided the user.
I have used content and collaborative based filtering techniques for completing the project.


In a content-based recommendation system, the background knowledge of the products and customer information are taken into consideration
For example, consider a scenario in which a person goes to buy his favorite cake ‘X’. Unfortunately, cake ‘X’ has been sold out and as a result of this the shopkeeper recommends the person to buy cake ‘Y’ which is made up of ingredients similar to cake ‘X’.
The benefits of content-based filtering include the ability to recommend unrated goods, the simplicity of explaining an item's Content feature, and the requirement for only the concerned user's rating, not that of any other system user.


Collaborative filtering provides suggestions on similar products and recommendations based on the similar profiles of its users.
For example, consider A and B are two users who are watching movies online on a specific platform, both of them watched the A1 movie and then watched the B2 movie(at different times). Now user B has watched movie A2, so this movie will also be for A who hadn’t watched that movie yet. 
There are mainly two types of collaborative filtering techniques Memory Based approach and the Model-Based approach. In Memory Based approach, the recommendation is done based on past activities, whereas in the model-based approach, some prediction will take place based on ratings, page viewing time, clicks, and so on.
